			<h1>Stand with me by these mountains</h1>
			<h2 class="post">June 2006</h2>
				
			<p>Stand with me by these mountains,<br/>
			And you will feel the Spirit burning.<br/>
			The bush is burning, the sea is turning,<br/>
			Towards the Light of Heaven.<br/>
			Sit with me on the hillside field.<br/>
			He fed five thousand children.<br/>
			They believed Him when He told them.<br/>
			He was the Bread of Life.<br/>
			Rise with me when He calls us,<br/>
			Out of the telestial towards His realm.<br/>
			When He comes again,<br/>
			Eternity expands,<br/>
			Skies become fire,<br/>
			And hearts are white stones<br/></p>
