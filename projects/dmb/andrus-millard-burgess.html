After his return home, he acted as a home missionary in the Jordan Stake and as second assistant stake superintendent of Y. M. M. I. A. in the Jordan Stake. Later he acted as first counselor in the same stake organization. After that he presided over the Draper Sunday school four years, and for a number of years served as a president of the 73rd Quorum of Seventy.
