    <p><strong>ASHTON, George Savage</strong>, the first Bishop of the Capitol Hill Ward (Salt Lake Stake), Salt Lake City, Utah, was born July 27, 1870, in Salt Lake City, the son of Edward Ashton and Jane Treharne. He was baptized July 27, 1878, by his father in the Jordan River, and received his education in the public schools and in the L. D. S. College in Salt Lake City. He was ordained a Deacon by Bishop Joseph Pollard, and an Elder in September, 1893, by James W. Ure. He was ordained a Seventy Oct. 9, 1893, by Apostle Francis M. Lyman and set apart for a mission to the Indian Territory, where he labored for 22 months in the Oklahoma Conference and six months as president of the Cherokee Conference. After returning home, he labored as an officer in the Y. M. M. I. A. of the 15th Ward. When the 24th Ward was created out of the western part of the 15th Ward he became choir leader, in which position he served six years and he also labored in the Y. M. M. I. A. Before going on his mission he married Leah Fidkin (a daughter of William Fidkin and Alice Crowton) in the Salt Lake Temple Sept. 21, 1893. She was born Feb. 27, 1872, in England and came to Utah with her parents in 1874. This marriage has been blessed with eight children, namely, Leah F., George W., Lucile Fidkin, Aliene F., Emma F., William Y., Melvin Alma and Reed Earl. Brother Ashton was ordained a High Priest June 19, 1904, by Pres. Joseph F. Smith and set apart as 2nd counselor to Bishop John W. Boud of the 15th Ward. This position he held for sixteen years, when he was called to act as a High Councilor in the Salt Lake Stake. In 1920 he moved to the 19th Ward, and when the Capitol Hill Ward was organized from a part of the 19th Ward, Bro. Ashton became a member of that ward; and, being called to preside over the same, he was ordained a Bishop April 19, 1925, by Apostle Richard R. Lyman. Under his administration, one of the finest meeting houses in the Church has been erected in the Capitol Hill Ward.</p>

    <p>Bishop Ashton, whose chief avocation is that of a contractor and builder, was honorably released as Bishop of the Capitol Hill Ward Dec. 28, 1930, since which time he has acted as a member of the Salt Lake Stake High Council.</p>
