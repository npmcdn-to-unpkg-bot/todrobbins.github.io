    <p><strong>ANDERSON, Daniel</strong>, first Bishop of the Moroni East Ward, Moroni Stake, Sanpete Co., Utah, was born March 28, 1866, in Aiken, Veile Amt, Denmark, the son of <a href="">Niels J. Andersen</a> and <a href="">Karen Marie Nielsen</a>. He emigrated with his parents to Utah in 1872 and located at Moroni, where he has resided ever since. There he was baptized Sept. 13, 1874, by <a href="">John Blackham</a>, and ordained successively to the offices of Teacher, Priest and Elder. In September, 1886, he married <a href="">Violet Cloward</a> in the Logan Temple. The children of this union are <a href="">Mary C.</a>, <a href="">Addie</a> (deceased), <a href="">Raphel</a>, <a href="">Daniel J.</a>, <a href="">Dora</a> and <a href="">Vivian</a>. Brother Anderson filled a mission to Norway in 1904, laboring in the Christiania Conference, part of the time as president of the Fredrikshald Branch. He was ordained a Seventy by <a href="">Jacob H. Jensen</a>, July 9, 1905, and acted for several years as a president of the 37th quorum of Seventy. In 1907-1908 he filled another mission, this time to the Northern States, during which he acted part of the time as president of the St. Paul (Minnesota) Branch. On this second mission he was accompanied by his wife. After returning from this mission, he acted as a stake Sunday school officer, and on Dec. 12, 1914, he was ordained a High Priest by Apostle <a href="">George F. Richards</a> and set apart as second counselor to Bishop <a href="">Orlando Bradley</a> of Moroni. He acted in that capacity until Dec. 19, 1920, when Moroni was divided into two wards, and Elder Anderson was ordained a Bishop by <a href="">Orson F. Whitney</a> and set apart to preside over the Moroni East Ward, which position he held until April, 1928. He is a member of the High Council at present. Brother Anderson is a farmer by avocation, and a leading citizen of the community in which he resides.</p>
