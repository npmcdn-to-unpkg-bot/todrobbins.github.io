    <p><strong>ANDERSON, James Henry</strong>, a prominent Elder in the Ensign Stake of Zion, was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, Feb. 11, 1857, the son of James Anderson and Catharine Mary Cowley. His early school training was by his mother, and in the district schools. In 1869 and 1870 he was a student at the Deseret University. Leaving that institution in 1871 he entered the employ of the "Deseret News." He served an apprenticeship in the composing departments and became an expert book and job printer. In 1877 he was associated with John E. Callister and Emmett D. Mousley in starting the Star Printing Office, withdrawing in October of that year to become the foreman of the "Deseret News" book and job printing departments. He acted in that position over seven years, during which period many important publications in English and other languages were printed under his supervision. In February, 1885, he was made city editor of the "Deseret News," which position he filled with marked success until August, 1890, when he was called on a mission to Europe. His services in the local department of the "Deseret News" editorial work covered most of the period of anti-"Mormon" prosecution under the Edmunds and Edmunds-Tucker laws, and gave to him valuable experience.</p>

    <p>On his return from Europe in 1892 he was associated for a time with Bishop Orson F. Whitney, on Volume II of the History of Utah, and in the spring of 1893 he again became connected with the "Deseret News" editorial department. While there he compiled the first history written of the Salt Lake Temple, from the laying of the cornerstone to the dedication of the completed structure.</p>

    <p>This history appears in the "Contributor" of April, 1893 (Vol. 14).</p>

    <p>The committee on admission of Church members to the dedication of the Salt Lake Temple from April 6 to April 24, 1893, were John Nicholson, Joseph E. Taylor, and James H. Anderson. The Church recommend of each individual had to be presented, and the apportionment of admissions regulated for each session. Elder Nicholson was clerk of the conference and Elder Taylor otherwise engaged within the Temple. This left the task of arranging and regulating the companies to Elder Anderson. Under his personal direction 128,000 people passed into and out of the Temple during the dedicatory exercises, without confusion or mishap.</p>

    <p>From 1893 until the beginning of 1901 he continued with the "Deseret News," being variously engaged in every department of editorial work. Jan. 4, 1901, he retired from the "Deseret News," and on Jan. 7, 1901, assumed the duties of county commissioner in Salt Lake County, to which position he had been elected in November, 1900. He was chosen chairman of the board of county commissioners. His work in public office has been characterized by the same faithful care and attention that were given his previous labors. Elder Anderson is of a thoughtful, reserved disposition, not given to ostentation. He was well trained by his parents in temperate religious habits, and followed closely the parental instruction and example In February, 1864, he united with the Sunday School in the Sixth Ward, Salt Lake City, and retained his membership to 1905, being a diligent worker in the Sunday school cause, for years past, as a theological class teacher and in the school superintendency. In 1873 he became associated with mutual improvement work in his ward, and has shown active interest therein ever since. At the age of eight years, he was baptized by his father. In 1871 he was ordained a Deacon, two years later a Priest, and on Feb. 6, 1876, a Seventy. In 1881 he married Mary A. Abbott, a native of Abergavenny, England. In 1893 he was chosen one of the seven presidents of the 2nd Quorum of Seventy, and when the 110th Quorum of Seventy was organized in 1897 he was chosen its senior president. From 1875 to 1890 he acted as clerk of the 6th Ward.</p>

    <p>Elder Anderson always has been energetic in his efforts to promote the dissemination of useful knowledge. In promulgating the principles of the Gospel he has been especially active among the youth residing in his vicinity. In the autumn of 1884 he was called to labor as a home missionary in the Salt Lake Stake of Zion, and until his release in 1890 to go on a foreign mission, he kept every appointment made for him. In September, 1890, he went to Indian Territory, visiting at Manard, the headquarters of that mission, with his brother, Franklin M., who was a missionary in that field. He then journeyed to Great Britain, where he was appointed as a traveling Elder in the London conference. His labors there were in the Kent, Whitechapel and North London districts. In December, 1890, he was called to Liverpool, and from that time until his return home, in October, 1892, Elder Anderson conducted the editorial work of the "Millennial Star;" he also wrote several tracts, and spent much of his time in traveling and preaching. Among the notable addresses given by him is one before the South Place Ethical Institute, London, on "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, its History, Mission and Destiny." He isited every conference in the British Mission, and in July, 1892, made a trip to France.</p>

    <p>On his return to Utah he again became a home missionary in the Salt Lake Stake of Zion, and was actively engaged till a long and severe illness in 1898 necessitated his release. Since 1900, when his health improved, he has done considerable public speaking, chiefly on historical and biblical subjects. In August, 1898, he accompanied Apostle Francis M. Lyman on the latter's tour of the Stakes of Zion in central and southern Utah. As a public speaker. Elder Anderson is clear, earnest and logical. The same characteristics mark his writings, most of which consist of magazine and newspaper articles. His historical and descriptive sketch of the Temple in Salt Lake City, first published in "The Contributor" in 1893, is recognized as an authoritative statement of facts connected with the building of that sacred edifice.</p>

    <p>In 1902 James H. Anderson was re-elected commissioner of Salt Lake County and retained his place as chairman of the commission. He was instrumental in the institution of hard surface roads in the county and among the first to install street lighting conveniences outside of cities. He planned and drew up the law forming county school districts, which law was passed by the Utah Legislature of 1905, and went into effect throughout the State. He was State chairman of the Republican party in Utah when Reed Smoot was elected United States senator. In February, 1903, he accompanied Senator Smoot to Washington, and as a contest was instituted against Senator Smoot, Chairman Anderson interviewed President Roosevelt and the leading Republican senators, explaining to them the situation. He was present when Senator Smoot was sworn in on March 4, 1903. An interesting item of national history at that time and which was a topic of discussion with reference to Senator Smoot, was that the senator furnished the one senator of the two-thirds needed to pass the Panama treaty which enabled the United States to build the Panama Canal.</p>

    <p>In March, 1903, Chairman Anderson returned to his duties on the Salt Lake County Commission. In December, 1904, he returned to Washington with Senator Smoot, and took an active part in the Senator's behalf until the case was finally and favorably disposed of in February, 1906. His interest in Utah politics, especially in connection with the election and presence of Senator Smoot in the U. S. Senate, continued during the entire period of the senator's service. His political addresses avoid entirely any personal criticism of political antagonists.</p>

    <p>In 1907, Elder Anderson was made a member of the General Board of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Associations in the Church, and continued in that position for upwards of 22 years. He also continued as a Sunday school teacher, as teacher in the quorum of Seventy, and in active public service, particularly in teaching the Scriptures, both ancient and modern. Nov. 23, 1929, he was ordained to the office of High Priest. As a ward teacher in the wards where he resided, he has had, up to 1931, upwards of thirty years actual service. In his public appointments as speaker and lecturer on religious subjects -- sometimes to exceed 100 in a year up to the present (1932) he has never failed to fill his appointments. His addresses have been made in many of the States of the Union from New York to California and in Europe. Some of his gospel tracts have been translated from English into other languages, including German, the Scandinavian languages and Maori. His later works have included manuals for the Mutual Improvement Associations, the most elaborate of these being "Ten Women of the Olden Days," of which a limited special edition was issued in book form, and copies placed in the Congressional Library at Washington, D. C, the Los Angeles Public Library, and other public libraries. His historical lectures on Biblical history and prophecy are notable for having included up-to-date fulfilment of prophecies. In preparing missionaries for work in their fields of labor, he is one of those engaged in that service at the Church Missionary Home in Salt Lake City. He also is one of the founders of the Utah Genealogical Society, and a member of the Institute of American Genealogy and of other genealogical societies in the United States, as well as of still other societies in America and Europe engaged in gathering genealogical and historical information, of which he is a close student.</p>

    <p>In 1906, he was made chief deputy U. S. Internal Revenue Collector of the District of Montana, embracing the States of Montana, Utah, and Idaho, under Collector Edward H. Callister, and continued in that position until 1909, when President Wm. H. Taft appointed him United States Marshal for the district of Utah. His wife, Mary A., died in 1903, and in December, 1904, he married Elise S. Schneider, daughter of Christian Schneider and Susannah Klosner. At the close of his term as United States Marshal, in 1914, his wife Elise died. His wife Mary A. had five children, two sons and three daughters. The two sons, Edgar J. and Albert H., died, and are buried at Salt Lake City. The three daughters, Florence M. Horsley, Mabel E. Moore and Dessie M. Anderson still live; also two grandchildren; one grandchild is June Anderson Moore, daughter of Mabel. His wife Elise left two daughters, twins, Alta E. Baldwin and Ellen E. Ander- son of Salt Lake City, Utah. One grandchild is Alta's son, Theodore N. Baldwin. Ellen's daughter, Barbara May, died, and is buried at Salt Lake City.</p>

    <p>In July, 1921, President Harding appointed James H. Anderson as United States Collector of Internal Revenue for the district of Utah, and he has continued to hold that position under Presidents Coolidge and Hoover. He is active in all his duties, State, Church, and educational.</p>
