		<p>This project has been a collaboration with a <a href="http://home.byu.edu/home/">Brigham Young University</a> professor over the past few years. He has assembled a large array of resources concerning the life of the Mormon prophet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith">Joseph Smith, Jr.</a>, and his successors. I have been assisting with information architecture and designing a new site for him in my free time. I have utilized technologies such as: <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language 5">HTML5</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, Javascript, and MySQL/PHP for text retrieval. We also run informal user tests to ensure the user experience is acceptable to casual users and researchers alike.</p>

		<p>I have learned many useful skills in the process, including processing large text data sets and manipulating those texts for display on the Web. Our collaboration is ongoing and we intend to release a new version of the site in the coming months.</p>

		<p>I was hired as a freelance contractor by <a href="http://www.humless.com">Humless</a> to design their initial web presence as a new manufacturing company. I developed the site using new techniques in HTML5 and CSS3, focusing on user experience. I helped the company find its brand by focusing on content that mattered.</p>

		<p>Working with <a href="http://www.humless.com">Humless</a> through the various iterations of the design mockups, production prototypes, and final website was a much needed growth experience in my professional development as a user experience designer. The opportunity to work as a freelance designer allowed me to interact and collaborate with Humless on important design decisions.</p>

		<p>Working with the founder of <a href="http://utahforeststewards.org/">Utah Forest Stewards</a>, I set up and developed the <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> site for their organization. I administer the site and contribute content occasionally. The Utah Forest Stewards site is one of many WordPress sites I have created, designed, or administered in the past 5 years.</p>

		<p>I also helped coordinate community outreach as the organization launched. This experience and others have helped me hone my awareness and concentrated use of social media and collaborative tools to make a difference in the communities I have lived in. A good librarian should always be anxiously engaged in a good cause.</p>
