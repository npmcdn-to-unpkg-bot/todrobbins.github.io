		</aside>

		<p>At the Utah Valley University Sutherland Archives, I cataloged and digitized hundreds of items ranging from college newspapers and yearbooks to personal manuscript collections and peace activist oral histories. I learned how to automate scanning processes and image editing with Photoshop. I also learned how to manage large amounts of image files as I amassed more collections during my work at UVU.</p>

		<p>The experiences I had at UVU's Archives taught me the value of organization, synthesis, and quality assurance. Working with the staff archivist, I completed my tasks in good time and produced exceptional products that were influential in spreading the word about the Archives' new location and facilities in the Utah Valley University Library.</p>

		</aside>

		<p>I worked with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints History Department in the documentary editing process of a large journal collection of an early church leader, George Q. Cannon. I was involved in transcription verification, preliminary annotation authoring, XML entity tagging, and other research.</p>

		<p>The usefulness of hands-on archives work in developing one's skills cannot be overstated. I learned new processes in the research with which I was involved that prepared me for further analysis of source documents in my current research endeavors. I have even come full circle with XML as I studied it at the UW (XML Info Structures) and in my free time in relation to text encoding and the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/ead/">Encoded Archival Description standard</a>.</p>

		<p>My work with libraries, archives, and museums has shown I work well with others: faculty, programmers, library, and curatorial staff have enjoyed having me as a team member in these projects. I have grown substantially as a professional and practioner over the past few years and look forward my future in the field.</p>

		<p>I am a web developer on multiple projects with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as a graduate student intern. I am building two web applications that serve researchers from various disciplines. One of the applications is for studying and visualizing data extracted from Danish Meteorological Annuals, dating 1893-1908, which may serve as a prototype for other data explorer apps. The other application is being built as an encyclopedic companion site to the Old Weather project by Zooniverse, dealing with United States Coast Guard ship logs.</p>

		<p>Users will be able to search the records and media related to ships, people, and places on the the Old Weather service. I have implemented a combination of jQuery libraries, CSS3 animations/transitions, and SIMILE widgets for displaying content in a rich format. Through these experiences I have developed useful skills, but look forward to enhancing my knowledge as I work with experienced colleagues and continue to educate myself. I learn quickly and thrive on collaborating with others to envision and develop new ideas and solutions.</p>

		<p>I began the <a href="http://todrobbins.com/church-history/sap/">Saints of Alberta Project</a> with a couple of researchers in 2010 seeking to make more cultural resources and historical documents available concerning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latter_Day_Saint">Latter-day Saints</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta">Alberta, Canada</a>. We have been amassing digital copies of primary sources, including: letters, journals, photographs, etc., to our online archive for the past year and a half. I maintain the website and am in the midst of developing a catalog system for search and retrieval of the documents we have collected.</p>

		<p>As the <a href="http://todrobbins.com/church-history/sap/">Saints of Alberta Project</a> has been a purely volunteer effort, the effort progressed in an intriguing fashion. The onus on me to maintain professional standards has been immense and yet I am proud to gather a community around a topic and seek to build bridges for sharing culture, history, and information.</p>
